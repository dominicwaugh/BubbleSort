# BubbleSort
In this project, I created a method that uses a bubble sort method to sort a data set given.





### Below I have pasted the chart of points that I created through Excel.
As you can see, the points seem to follow an increasing slope which means that the function appears to be parabolic.
We can observe the asymptotic analysis of the Big O of the sort method to be O(N<sup>2</sup>).
Considering the shape of the plot below, we can assume that O(N<sup>2</sup>) follows a similar path to that of the function below.
We observe that the points at N = 10,000 took fourfold the time of the points at N = 5,000.
We can also observe through the points that as the value of N gets bigger, the variance of time increases.
However, the points still follow a general  parabolic path.
In summary, the actual runtime results are consistent with the theoretical expectations provided by Big O analysis.
The sorting algorithm exhibits O(N<sup>2</sup>) behavior, where the execution time grows rapidly as the input size increases.
